This research, entitled **"Exploring the Limits of OthelloGPT's Emergent Representations"**, was conducted over 10 weeks in Summer 2023 as part of UChicago's XLab Research Fellowship.

I was supervised by David Reber and Victor Veitch, and sought to expand on earlier work by [Li et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382) and [Neel Nanda](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nmxzr2zsjNtjaHh7x/actually-othello-gpt-has-a-linear-emergent-world) that used the toy problem of predicting legal moves in the board game Othello to study world representations in transformer models
